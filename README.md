# Engineworks\DBAL - Database Abstraction Layer

This library was created to abstract the interactions with a relational database.
At the time it was created the PDO extension does not exists.
If possible try to use PDO instead of this library, mostly because prepared statements.

I'm maintaining this library because I have several applications depending on this
and I had shared this to other people, so they can also maintain their own projects.

# Installation

To install this library you can use:
```bash
composer require eclipxe/engineworks-dbal
```

# DBAL

Main connection object, has several query methods to get the results just as needed.
It also contains sql methods to translate SQL Dialects from different drivers.

# Recordset

The Recordset class mimics the main methods of the recordset:

- Open the recordset using a SQL Statement
- Walk the recordset using the current cursor
- Access values using the values array, stores original values
- Use of magic methods Update and Delete
- Convert from/to database types to common types

# Pager

The Pager class uses Recordset to access a limited page of a query, it does not load
all the records but only the requested ones

# Drivers

It support Mysqli and Sqlite3 drivers, you are free to create your own and share it with me.

# Compatibility

This class will be compatible according to [PHP Supported versions](http://php.net/supported-versions.php),
Security Support. This means that it will offer compatibility with PHP 5.6+ until 2018-12-31.

The support for version 5.5+ is not included since this PHP version end 2016-06-10
and that is lower than the release of first version of this library.

Not taking particular efforts to make this library compatible with hhvm.
