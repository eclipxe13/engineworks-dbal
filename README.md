# eclipxe13/engineworks-dbal - Database Abstraction Layer

This library was created to abstract the interactions with a relational database.
At the time it was created the PDO extension does not exists.
If possible try to use PDO instead of this library, mostly because prepared statements.

I'm maintaining this library because I have several applications depending on this
and I had shared this to other people, so they can also maintain their own projects.

## Installation

To install this library you can use:
```bash
composer require eclipxe/engineworks-dbal
```

## EngineWorks\DBAL\DBAL

Main connection object, has several query methods to get the results just as needed.
It also contains sql methods to translate SQL Dialects from different drivers.

## EngineWorks\DBAL\Recordset

The Recordset class mimics the main methods of the recordset:

- Open the recordset using a SQL Statement
- Walk the recordset using the current cursor
- Access values using the values array, stores original values
- Use of magic methods Update and Delete
- Convert from/to database types to common types

Some drivers does not know how to get the primary keys on a query,
in that case you can specify the entity to affect and also the primary keys.

Mysql driver support this feature, it will check for primary keys,
auto incrementing fields or unique indexes.

## EngineWorks\DBAL\Pager

The Pager class uses Recordset to access a limited page of a query, it does not load
all the records but only the requested ones

## About drivers

It support Mysqli, Mssql and Sqlite3 drivers, you are free to create your own and (please) share it with me.

### Mysqli

- This is the most tested driver on production.

### Mssql

- This driver is based on PDO dblib, you will need FreeTDS.
- Result does not know the entity or primary keys of the query.
  Use overrideEntity and overrideKeys when create a Recordset for update or delete.
- The function to quote (PDO::quote) fail with multibyte strings, we are
  using simple replacements of `'` to `''`

### Sqlite3

- Result does not know the entity or primary keys of the query.
  Use overrideEntity and overrideKeys when create a Recordset for update or delete.
- When a result is empty (nothing to fetch) it is not possible to know the type
  of the fields, this make this driver unstable to update using Recordset.
- The method SQLite3Result::fetchArray put the cursor in the first position
  when called after end of list. This behavior is corrected on Result and fetch
  returns always false.

## Compatibility

This class will be compatible according to [PHP Supported versions](http://php.net/supported-versions.php),
Security Support. This means that it will offer compatibility with PHP 5.6+ until 2018-12-31.

The support for version 5.5+ is not included since this PHP version end 2016-06-10
and that is lower than the release of first version of this library.

Not taking particular efforts to make this library compatible with hhvm.
