# TODO & Ideas

- DBAL::sqlQuote could be a final public method
- Include prepared (or simulated prepared) statements
- Include PDO Driver
- Evolve Recordset to allow PDO or DBAL
- Create ReadOnlyRecordSet as a light object
- Evolve Pager to stop using Recordset and depends on Result or another light object
- Test with more than 96% coverage
