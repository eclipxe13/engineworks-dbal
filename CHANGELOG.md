# Version 2.3.0 2021-06-14

Notice: If you are just using this library then it does not introduce any breaking change.
If you are hacking or extending the objects of this library then this can be a backwards incompatible change.  

- Minimal support for PHP is now 7.3.
- Convert `DBAL` to an interface, previous DBAL has been moved to `Abstracts\BaseDBAL`
- Fix bugs and add tests on `DBAL::sqlDatePart()`:
  - Mssql & Sqlsrv did not return leading zeros.
  - Sqlite uses different formats for minutes and second (not ansi).
- Ensure PHP 8.0 compatibility:
  - `SQLite3Result::finalize()` no longer produces a Warning, it now throws an error.
  - `mysqli_result::data_seek(int $offset)` cannot be called with a negative integer.
  - Since `pdo_sqlsrv:5.9.0` if create the `PDO` object using `PDO::ATTR_FETCH_TABLE_NAMES` throws an error on statement execution
    with message `Cannot create PDO object for SqlSrv SQLSTATE[IMSSP]: An unsupported attribute was designated on the PDO object.`.
- Moved parameters and return types from documentation to code.
- Upgrade to PHPStan 1.2.
- Update License file.
- Update build commands, utilities, config files, etc.
- Migrate from Travis-CI to GitHub Workflows. Thanks Travis-CI.
